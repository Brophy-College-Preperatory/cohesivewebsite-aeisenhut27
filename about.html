    <p>I am passionate and filled with joy at the existence of chairs.</p>
    <p>If you really think about is, without chairs, it would kinda suck a lot.</p>
    <p>My back would hurt very much without any chairs, and so would my legs because I could not sit down.</p>
    <p>With chairs, I can sit down and relax to do anything that has to do with sitting down (seditary activities)!</p>
